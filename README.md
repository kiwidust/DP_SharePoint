<p>The DP_SharePoint library provides tools to make working with Microsoft SharePoint simpler.  The library has been tested with Sharepoint 2007 and 2010 and, as it is a work in progress, should be considered BETA quality.  The library provides:</p>
<ul><li>Methods to acquire JavaScript handlers to SharePoint form controls and fields.  This make it much simpler to interrogate or add event handlers to SharePoint forms.</li>
	<li>Simple methods to add or remove events from SharePoint form elements.</li>
	<li>Simple methods to hide and show elements of SharePoint forms.</li>
	<li>Methods to simplify the calling and use of SharePoint web services and ready the data returned from them for use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The extensions are self-contained and present an extremely small footprint.  Only a single global object, "DP_SharePoint", is created.</p>
<p>This component requires a JavaScript (ECMAScript) 1.3 (or better) development environment and has been tested successfully on Internet Explorer 8+.</p>
